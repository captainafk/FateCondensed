  Description: 'Specialized, arcane knowledge that falls outside of the scope of

    Academics,
    including supernatural topics of one sort or another. This is where the weird
    stuff happens. Lore stunts often support practical applications of your arcane
    knowledge, such as casting spells. Some settings mayremove Lore, replace it with
    a different skill, or combine it with Academics.'
