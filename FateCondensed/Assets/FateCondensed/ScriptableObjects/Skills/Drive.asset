  Description: 'Controlling vehicles under the most grueling circumstances, pulling

    wicked
    maneuvers, and simply getting the most out of your ride. Drive stunts can be
    signature maneuvers, a special vehicle of your own, or the ability to use Drive
    in place of a skill like Burglary or Academics under certain circumstances.'
